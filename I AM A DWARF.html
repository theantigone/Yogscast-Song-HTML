  <h2>Terminators</h2>
  <p>There was once a T-1000 who was walking down Germantown Drive when suddenly a T-888 popped out of nowhere. "Yo 'aint goin' nowhere, flat foot." <b><i>"Calvin and Hobbes Reference"</i></b></p>
  <p><details><font color="b8860b">Note: Put your sarcasm detectors on</details></font>The T-1000, with his most calmest voice, responded. "OH WHAT YOU SAY!!??!!?!?!??!? YOU WANT TO GET TERMINATED!?!?!??!!?"<details><font color="b8860b">Note: You can take them off now</details></font> The T-888 cracked his knuckles (if he has any)</p>
  <p>The T-1000 started to get ready to terminate "They call me Dwarf, because of my mining and metalworking skills, what's yours?" The T-888 replied with his robotic voice "Dey call meh duh Boxer, mainly because I am a tough-looking dude, but also because I can pack a punch."</p>
  <p>"Let's get started then, eh?" Dwarf forcefully said. "I'mma ready for anythin'!" Boxer strongly responded. <i>"The two fought each other as the time passes. It's been five and a half hours since they fought, and so far, the T-888 is winning. Guess who is going to win...?"</i>

  <h2>Song</h2>

  <p><font color="008080">Diggy Diggy Hole (Song) by the YOGSCAST Lewis & Simon</font></p>
  <p>Brothers of the mine rejoice!
Swing, swing, swing with me
Raise your pick and raise your voice!
Sing, sing, sing with me
Down and down into the deep,
Who knows what we'll find beneath?
Diamonds, rubies, gold and more
Hidden in the mountain store.</p>

  <p>Born underground, suckled from a teat of stone.
Raised in the dark, the safety of our mountain home.
Skin made of iron, steel in our bones,
To dig and dig makes us free!
Come on brothers sing with me!</p>

  <p><font color="ff00ff">[Chorus]</font>

  <p>I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole</p>

  <p>The sunlight will not reach this low
Deep, deep in the mine
Never seen the blue moon glow
Dwarves won't fly so high
Fill a glass and down some mead!
Stuff your bellies at the feast!
Stumble home and fall asleep
Dreaming in our mountain keep</p>

  <p>Born underground, grown inside a rocky womb
The earth is our cradle; the mountain shall become our tomb
Face us on the battlefield; you will meet your doom
We do not fear what lies beneath
We can never dig too deep</p>

  <p><font color="ff00ff">[Chorus]</font></p>

  <p>I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole!</p>

  <p><font color="ff00ff">[Chorus]</font></p>

  <p>I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole!</p>

  <p><font color="00bfff">(Instrumental)</font></p>

  <p>Born underground, suckled from a teat of stone
Raised in the dark, the safety of our mountain home
Skin made of iron, steel in our bones
To dig and dig makes us free
Come on brothers sing with me!</p>

  <p><font color="ff00ff">[Chorus]</font></p>

  <p>I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole!</p>

  <p><font color="ff00ff">[Chorus]</font></p>

  <p>I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole!</p>
